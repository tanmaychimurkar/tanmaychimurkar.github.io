The main drawback we saw was that for functions, the return value changes ownership and the original variable is no longer usable. In this chapter, we will look at a continuation of ownership, i.e. references.\nReferences Instead of passing variables to functions, we can pass references to functions. reference is like a pointer we can follow to get to the data. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to valid data for the life of that reference.\nIn rust, references can be used as follows:\nfn main() { let s1 = String::from(\"hello\"); let len = calculate_length(\u0026s1); println!(\"The length of '{}' is {}.\", s1, len); // here s is valid as we only pass its reference } fn calculate_length(s: \u0026String) -\u003e usize { // we need to pass the type of the reference s.len() } In the above function, passing the ampersand String instead of String is called referencing and it allows us to refer to a value without taking ownership of it. Since the value s in the function is only referenced and not owned, it will not be dropped when the function ends, and would thus still be valid.\nThis action of creating a reference and passing it to a function that accepts a reference is called borrowing, since we are only borrowing a value and not taking ownership of it! Neat!!!!\nModifying borrowed values What were to happen if we try to modify a value we have borrowed? For example, in the function below, we try to modify the reference that is passed to the function:\nfn main() { let s = String::from(\"hello\"); update_string(\u0026s); fn update_string(s: \u0026String) { s.push_str(\", world!\"); } } If we try to run the above code, we will get the following error:\n$ cargo run Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership) error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*some_string` as mutable, as it is behind a `\u0026` reference --\u003e src/main.rs:8:5 | 7 | fn change(some_string: \u0026String) { | ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `\u0026mut String` 8 | some_string.push_str(\", world\"); | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `some_string` is a `\u0026` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0596`. error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error The error is pretty self-explanatory. We cannot modify a value that we have borrowed. This is because when we pass a reference to a function, we are only allowed to read the value, not modify it. This is called immutable borrowing. This is also the same behaviour that we have seen for variables that are immutable by default in Chapter 3.\nMutable References Just as we had mutable variables, we can also have mutable references. We can create a mutable reference by using \u0026mut instead of \u0026:\nfn main() { let mut s = String::from(\"hello\"); update_string(\u0026mut s); fn update_string(s: \u0026mut String) { s.push_str(\", world!\"); } } In the above implementation, we pass the \u0026mut s to the function as reference instead of \u0026s. Next, we also pass the \u0026mut String to the function instead of \u0026String, implying that we are passing a mutable reference to the function.\nMajor restriction: We can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. In short, there can only be a single mutable reference to a particular variable that we can use.\nFor example, the following code will not compile:\nfn main() { let mut s = String::from(\"hello\"); let r1 = \u0026mut s; let r2 = \u0026mut s; println!(\"{}, {}\", r1, r2); } If we run the above code, it will raise the following error:\n$ cargo run Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership) error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time --\u003e src/main.rs:5:14 | 4 | let r1 = \u0026mut s; | ------ first mutable borrow occurs here 5 | let r2 = \u0026mut s; | ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here 6 | 7 | println!(\"{}, {}\", r1, r2); | -- first borrow later used here For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0499`. error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error Since we are trying to create two references r1 and r2 to the same variable s, the compiler will throw an error. The error is because we are borrowing the same variable a second time before the scope of the first variable is not finished.\nIf we were to change the above code to the following, it will run without this error:\nfn main() { let mut s = String::from(\"hello\"); let r1 = \u0026mut s; println!(\"The value of r1 is {r1}\"); let r2 = \u0026mut s; println!(\"The value of r1 is {r2}\"); } In this case, we are first ending the scope of r1 when we call print, and we are then creating a second reference r2 to the variable s. This is allowed by the compiler.\nResticting multiple mutable references: The main advantage for restricting multiple mutable references is that the compiler does not have data races at compile time. A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:\nTwo or more pointers access the same data at the same time. At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data. There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data. We can also use {} to scope a mutable reference such that there is no conflict between two mutable references:\nfn main() { let mut s = String::from(\"Hello\"); { let r1 = \u0026mut s; println!(\"The value of r1 is {}\", r1); } // scope of mutable reference is finished, and a new variable with mutable reference can be created let r2 = \u0026mut s; println!(\"The value of r2 is {}\", r2); } The above code will also compile, since the scope of the first mutable reference r1 is finished before we create the second mutable reference r2 by using {}.\nScope matters for mutable and immutable references! We can have multiple immutable references from a variable, since by nature, immutable references cannot change any value, and can be looked at as a read-only reference. However, we cannot put an mutable reference before the scope of the immutable reference is finished, since the mutable reference can change the value of the variable, and thus, the immutable reference will not be valid anymore.\nThis can be seen clearly from the below example:\nfn main() { let mut s = String::from(\"hello\"); let r1 = \u0026s; // no problem, since immutable reference used let r2 = \u0026s; // no problem, since immutable reference used let r3 = \u0026mut s; // BIG PROBLEM, mutable reference used before immutable references are finished println!(\"{}, {}, and {}\", r1, r2, r3); // will not compile } Running the above code will raise the following error:\n$ cargo run Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership) error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable --\u003e src/main.rs:6:14 | 4 | let r1 = \u0026s; // no problem | -- immutable borrow occurs here 5 | let r2 = \u0026s; // no problem 6 | let r3 = \u0026mut s; // BIG PROBLEM | ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here 7 | 8 | println!(\"{}, {}, and {}\", r1, r2, r3); | -- immutable borrow later used here For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`. error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error As we can see, the compiler will not allow us to create a mutable reference r3 before the immutable references r1 and r2 are finished. This is because the mutable reference r3 can change the value of the variable s, and thus, the immutable references r1 and r2 will not be valid anymore.\nHowever, the below code is valid and will compile:\nfn main() { let mut s = String::from(\"hello\"); let r1 = \u0026s; // no problem, read-only let r2 = \u0026s; // no problem, read-only println!(\"{} and {}\", r1, r2); // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point let r3 = \u0026mut s; // no problem even if modified println!(\"{}\", r3); } Dangling references For languages with pointers, it is possible that a reference can point to a location that is given to another variable, or free some other variables memory by mistake. In rust, the compiler never lets us create dangling references to a variable. If we have a reference to some data, the compiler will make sure that the data does not go out of scope before the reference is out of scope.\nLet’s look at the below example to see how rust prevents us creating a dangling reference.\nfn main() { let some_reference = dangle(); // is a reference to a return value of a function fn dangle() -\u003e \u0026String { let s = String::from(\"hello\"); // s comes into scope at this line \u0026s // create a reference to s and return it } // the function finishes and s goes out of scope after this line, so the reference has nothing to // point to } Running the above, we get the following error:\nerror[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier --\u003e src/main.rs:6:20 | 6 | fn dangle() -\u003e \u0026String { | ^ expected named lifetime parameter | = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from help: consider using the `'static` lifetime | 6 | fn dangle() -\u003e \u0026'static String { | +++++++ The error says that this functions's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from. This is because the variable s goes out of scope after the function dangle finishes, and thus, the reference \u0026s has nothing to point to.\nInstead of returning a reference in the above function, we need to return s directly, and take ownership of the variable s in the function dangle:\nWe can see how a plan comes together in rust with ownership and scope.\nIn the next chapter, we will look at a different kind of reference, called slice.\n","wordCount":"1691","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-orig-noshadow.png","datePublished":"2023-05-03T08:23:15Z","dateModified":"2023-05-03T08:23:15Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tanmay"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/posts/rust/chap6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tanmay's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io accesskey=h title="Tanmay's Blog (Alt + H)">Tanmay's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/categories title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Rust Documentation: Chapter 4 - Slices</h1><div class=post-description>This post gives a breakdown of the key takeaways from Chapter 4 - Slices the Rust Documentation</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-05-03 08:23:15 +0000 UTC'>May 3, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tanmay&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/tanmaychimurkar/tanmaychimurkar.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/rust/chap6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-orig-noshadow.png alt="Rust Crab"><p>The Rust crab, Ferris, with its arms folded</p></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#references aria-label=References>References</a><ul><li><a href=#modifying-borrowed-values aria-label="Modifying borrowed values">Modifying borrowed values</a></li><li><a href=#mutable-references aria-label="Mutable References">Mutable References</a></li><li><a href=#scope-matters-for-mutable-and-immutable-references aria-label="Scope matters for mutable and immutable references!">Scope matters for mutable and immutable references!</a></li><li><a href=#dangling-references aria-label="Dangling references">Dangling references</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In the <a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/posts/rust/chap4/ title="Rust Chapter 4">previous chapter</a>, we saw how ownership works in Rust.

thus, the reference <code>&amp;s</code> has nothing to point to.</p><p>Instead of returning a reference in the above function, we need to return <code>s</code> directly, and take ownership of
the variable <code>s</code> in the function <code>dangle</code>:</p><p>We can see how a plan comes together in <code>rust</code> with ownership and scope.</p><p>In the <a href=chap6.md>next</a> chapter, we will look at a different kind of reference, called <code>slice</code>.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/tags/rust/>Rust</a></li><li><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/tags/bare-metal/>bare metal</a></li><li><a href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/tags/embedded/>embedded</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://tanmaychimurkar.github.io/posts/docker/docker_images/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Docker Images and DockerFile</span></a>
